Among many proclivities, Cleopatra loved jewelry, particularly emeralds, which were once believed to hold all manner of mystical properties. Much like what we do today, Cleopatra made a habit of melting down existing gold jewelry and remaking it into its next incarnation. However the stone—and all the energy and magic within—remained. So it’s no wonder at all that Chelsey's curiosity and eventual choice to work with precious stones via Starling became both passion and livelihood.  <\/p>",
