Cleaning with harsh chemicals such as bleach, especially anything with Chlorine... and make sure to avoid swimming pools and hot tubs with Chlorine, which can cause discoloring and damage to fine jewelry. Also, you may want to avoid activities where your hands get extra dirty, as they can cause build-up on the jewelry (although it can usually be removed easily). This may include activities such as gardening, working with clay, cooking, or using lotion\/oils. Please use extra caution with softer stones such as pearls, turquoise, and opals.<\/p><p>In order to avoid tarnishing, it is important to remove any item that is Gold-Dipped Silver before getting it wet or using lotions and perfumes.<\/p>",
